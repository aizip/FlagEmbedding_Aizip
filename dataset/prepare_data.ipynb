       "  'text': \"How Airbags Work\\nAirbags inflate when sensors detect an impact that exceeds \\ndeployment thresholds. These thresholds are designed to \\npredict the severity of a crash in time for the airbags to help \\nprotect the vehicle's occupants. Airbags inflate instantly with \\nconsiderable force accompanied by a loud noise. The inflated \\nbag, together with the seat belts, limits movement of \\noccupants to reduce the risk of injury.\\nFront airbags are not ordinarily designed to inflate in rear \\ncollisions, rollovers, side collisions and when braking heavily \\nor driving over bumps and potholes. Likewise, front airbags \\nmay not inflate in all frontal collisions, such as minor front \\ncollisions, underride collisions, or minor impacts with narrow \\nobjects (such as posts or poles). Significant superficial \\ndamage can occur to the vehicle without the airbags inflating \\nand, conversely, a relatively small amount of structural \\ndamage can cause airbags to inflate. Therefore, the external \\nappearance of the vehicle after a collision does not represent \\nwhether or not the front airbags should have inflated.\\nWARNING: Before modifying your vehicle to \\naccommodate a person with disabilities in a way that \\nmay affect the airbag system, use the mobile app to \\nschedule a service appointment.\\nTypes of Airbags\\nModel Y has the following types of airbags:\\n• Front airbags: The front airbags are designed to reduce \\ninjuries if larger children or adults are riding in the front \\nseats. Follow all warnings and instructions related to \\nseating a child on the front passenger seat (if permitted in \\nyour market region).\\n• Knee airbags: Knee airbags and the front airbags work \\ntogether. The knee airbags limit the forward motion of the \\nfront seat occupants by restricting leg movement, thereby \\npositioning the occupants so that the front airbags work \\nmore effectively.\\n• Seat-mounted side airbags: A seat-mounted side airbag \\nin the front seats helps protect the pelvis and the thorax \\nregion of the torso; the seat-mounted far side airbag in \\nthe inside portion of the driver’s seat helps protect the \\nhead and torso.\"},\n",

Driving one \\nmile/1.6 km warms the tires sufficiently to affect tire \\npressures. Parking the vehicle in direct sunlight or in \\nhot weather can also affect tire pressures. If you must \\ncheck warm tires, expect increased pressures. Do not \\nlet air out of warm tires in an attempt to match \\nrecommended cold tire pressures. A hot tire at or \\nbelow the recommended cold tire inflation pressure \\nmay be dangerously under-inflated.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Model Y has one of the most sophisticated battery systems \\nin the world. The most important way to preserve the high \\nvoltage Battery is to LEAVE YOUR VEHICLE PLUGGED IN \\nwhen you are not using it. This is particularly important if you \\nare not planning to drive Model Y for several weeks.\\nNOTE: When left idle and unplugged, your vehicle \\nperiodically uses energy from the Battery for system tests \\nand recharging the low voltage battery when necessary.\\nThere is no advantage to waiting until the Battery’s level is \\nlow before charging. In fact, the Battery performs best when \\ncharged regularly.\\nNOTE: If you allow the Battery to discharge to 0%, other \\ncomponents may become damaged or require replacement \\n(for example, the low voltage battery). In these cases, you are \\nresponsible for repair and/or transporting expenses. \\nDischarge-related expenses are not covered by the warranty \\nor under the Roadside Assistance policy.\\nThe peak charging rate of the Battery may decrease slightly \\nafter a large number of DC Fast Charging sessions, such as \\nthose at Superchargers. To ensure maximum driving range \\nand Battery safety, the Battery charge rate is decreased \\nwhen the Battery is too cold, the Battery’s charge is nearly \\nfull, and when the Battery conditions change with usage and \\nage. These changes in the condition of the Battery are driven \\nby battery physics and may increase the total Supercharging \\nduration by a few minutes over time. You can minimize the \\namount of charge time by using Trip Planner (if available in \\nyour market region) to warm the Battery while driving to a \\nSupercharger. See Trip Planner on page 163 for more \\ninformation.\\nBattery Care\\nNever allow the Battery to fully discharge.\\nEven when Model Y is not being driven, its Battery \\ndischarges very slowly to power the onboard electronics. The \\nBattery can discharge at a rate of approximately 1% per day, \\nthough the discharge rate may vary depending on \\nenvironmental factors (such as cold weather), vehicle \\nconfiguration, and your selected settings on the \\ntouchscreen.'},\n",

To protect against a complete \\ndischarge, Model Y enters a low-power consumption mode \\nwhen the displayed charge level drops to approximately 0%. \\nIn this mode, the Battery stops supporting the onboard \\nelectronics and auxiliary low voltage battery. Once this low-\\npower consumption mode is active, immediately plug in \\nModel Y to prevent a jump start and low voltage battery \\nreplacement.\\nNOTE: If Model Y is unresponsive and does not unlock, open, \\nor charge, the low voltage battery may be discharged.

However, driving downhill \\nallows your vehicle to regain a portion of its expended \\nenergy through regenerative braking (see Regenerative \\nBraking on page 77).\\n• Short trips or stop-and-go traffic: It takes energy to bring \\nthe cabin and Battery to a specified temperature when \\nstarting the vehicle. You may see a higher average \\nconsumption when the vehicle is used for very short trips \\nor in heavy traffic.\\n• Heavy cargo load.\\n• Windows rolled down.\\n• Wheels and tires not maintained.\\n• Customized settings or third-party accessories (roof or \\ntrunk racks, third party wheels).\\nWhile parked and not plugged in to a charger: \\n• Preconditioning the cabin or using climate controls.\\n• Summon.\\n• Vehicle infotainment and climate controls system.\\n• Sentry mode.\\n• Tesla or third-party mobile app requests.\\nTips to Maximize Range\\nYou can maximize your driving range using the same driving \\nhabits you use to conserve fuel in a gasoline-powered \\nvehicle. To achieve maximum range:\\n• Slow down your driving and avoid frequent and rapid \\nacceleration. Consider using Chill Mode (touch Controls > \\nDynamics > Acceleration) and Speed Assist (see Speed \\nAssist on page 140) to assist in controlling your \\nacceleration and speed.\\n• If safe to do so, modulate the accelerator pedal instead of \\nusing the brake pedal when gradually slowing down. \\nWhenever Model Y is moving and you are not pressing the \\naccelerator pedal, regenerative braking slows down the \\nvehicle and feeds surplus energy back to the Battery (see \\nRegenerative Braking on page 77).\\n• Limit the use of resources such as heating and air \\nconditioning. Using seat and steering wheel heaters (if \\nequipped) to keep warm is more efficient than heating the \\ncabin using climate controls.'},\n",

This bracket conforms to the shape of your \\nvehicle's front bumper and is adhered to it using strong \\nadhesive.\\nNOTE: Tesla recommends performing this procedure on a \\nclean, dry vehicle during a warm day. Cold and/or wet \\nconditions may result in reduced performance of the \\nadhesive.\\nTo install the front license plate bracket:\\n1. Get isopropyl alcohol and test it on a non-visible painted \\nsurface of your vehicle to confirm that it does not damage \\nor remove the paint.\\n2. Clean the mounting site with isopropyl alcohol and allow \\nto dry for at least one minute.\\nParts and Accessories\\n207\\nMaintenance\\n3. Fully remove the protective tape from the adhesive at the \\ntop of the bracket and partially remove the tape from the \\ntop of the adhesive on each side.
