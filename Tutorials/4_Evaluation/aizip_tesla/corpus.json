A camera is mounted above the rear license plate.\n2. Ultrasonic sensors (if equipped) are located in the front \nand rear bumpers.\n3. A camera is mounted in each door pillar.\n4. Three cameras are mounted to the windshield above the \nrear view mirror.\n5. A camera is mounted to each front fender.\n6. Radar (if equipped) is mounted behind the front bumper.\nModel Y is also equipped with high precision electronically-\nassisted braking and steering systems.\nCabin Camera\nYour Model Y may be equipped with a cabin camera located \nabove the rear view mirror. For more information, see Cabin \nCamera on page 141.\nDrive to Calibrate Cameras\nModel Y must maneuver with precision when Autopilot \nfeatures are being used. Therefore, before some features \nsuch as Lane Departure Avoidance and Automatic \nEmergency Braking can be used for the first time or after \nsome types of service repairs, cameras must complete a self-\ncalibration process. For your convenience, the touchscreen \ndisplays a progress indicator.\nWhen calibration is complete, Autopilot features, as well as \nActive Safety features, are available for use. Calibration \ntypically completes after driving 20-25 miles (32-40 km), \nbut the distance varies depending on road and environmental \nconditions. For example, calibration completes quicker when \ndriving on a straight road with multiple lanes (such as a \ncontrolled-access highway), with highly-visible lane \nmarkings (in the driving lane as well as the adjacent lanes). \nContact Tesla only if your Model Y has not completed the \ncalibration process after driving 100 miles (160 km) in the \ndescribed conditions.\nIf a camera has shifted from its calibrated position (for \nexample, the camera or windshield was replaced), you must \nclear the calibration. To do so, touch Controls > Service > \nCamera Calibration > Clear Calibration. When the calibration \nis cleared, Model Y repeats the calibration process. While \nthis helps re-calibrate the cameras in many cases, Clear \nCalibration may not resolve all camera and sensor concerns.\nNOTE: To calibrate, cameras require highly-visible lane \nmarkings in both the driving lane and adjacent lanes (at least \ntwo lanes over on each side of the vehicle).", "10021": "NOTE: To calibrate, cameras require highly-visible lane \nmarkings in both the driving lane and adjacent lanes (at least \ntwo lanes over on each side of the vehicle). For best results, \ndrive in the middle lane of a multi-lane highway (ideally with \nat least five lanes) that has clear lane markings and minimal \ntraffic.\nNOTE: If you attempt to use a feature that is not available \nuntil the calibration process is complete, the feature is \ndisabled and the touchscreen displays a message.\nNOTE: Model Y must repeat the calibration process if the \ncameras are serviced by Tesla, and in some cases, after a \nsoftware update.\nKeeping Cameras Free of Obstructions\nEnsure all cameras are clean and free of obstructions before \neach drive and before using Autopilot features (see Cleaning \na Camera on page 194). Dirty cameras and sensors (if \nequipped), as well as environmental conditions such as rain \nand faded lane markings, can affect Autopilot performance. If \na camera is obstructed or blinded, Model Y displays a \nmessage on the touchscreen and Autopilot features may not \nbe available. For more information on specific alerts, see \nTroubleshooting Alerts on page 234.\nCondensation can form inside the camera enclosures, \nespecially if you park your vehicle outside in cold or wet \nconditions.

A phone key supports automatic locking and \nunlocking.\n\u2022 Key card - Tesla provides two key cards that communicate \nwith Model Y using short range radio-frequency \nidentification (RFID) signals. Unlike the phone key and key \nfobs, the key card does not support automatic locking and \nunlocking. In situations where your phone key has a dead \nbattery, or is lost or stolen, use your key card to unlock, \ndrive, and lock Model Y.\n\u2022 Key fob - The key fob (if equipped) allows you to press \nbuttons to open the front and rear trunks, and unlock, \nlock, and drive Model Y. The key fob also supports \nautomatic locking and unlocking, if available in your \nregion (see Walk-Away Door Lock on page 25) and can \nbe used as a backup to your phone key.\nModel Y supports a total of 19 keys, which can include phone \nkeys, key cards, and up to four key fobs.\nCAUTION: Remember to bring a key with you when you \ndrive. Although you can drive Model Y away from its \nkey, you will be unable to power it back on after it \npowers off.\nPhone Key\nCAUTION: Do not leave your paired phone in your \nvehicle (for example, if you are hiking or at the beach). \nIf you must leave your phone in the vehicle, disable \nBluetooth and/or turn the phone off.\nUsing your phone as a key is a convenient way to access your \nModel Y. As you approach, your phone's Bluetooth signal is \ndetected and the doors unlock when you pull a door handle. \nLikewise, when you exit and walk away with the phone key, \ndoors automatically lock (provided the Walk-Away Door Lock \nfeature is turned on; see Walk-Away Door Lock on page \n25).\nBefore you can use a phone to access Model Y, follow these \nsteps to authenticate it (see Pairing a New Phone Key on \npage 23).", "10023": "Before you can use a phone to access Model Y, follow these \nsteps to authenticate it (see Pairing a New Phone Key on \npage 23).\nOnce a phone has been authenticated, it no longer requires \nan internet connection to be used as a phone key for Model \nY. However, to use the phone hands-free, access your \nphone's contacts, play media from it, etc., you must also pair \nit and connect it as a Bluetooth device (see Bluetooth on \npage 58).\nTo view a list of keys that can currently access Model Y, or to \nremove a phone key, touch Controls > Locks (see Managing \nKeys on page 23).\nModel Y can connect to three phone keys simultaneously. \nTherefore, if more than three phone keys are detected and \nyou want to authenticate or pair a different phone, move the \nother connected phone key(s) out of range or turn off its \nBluetooth setting.\nSome smartphones with NFC capability can be used to lock/\nunlock your vehicle, just like using a key card.

Avoid contact \nwith solvents, waxes, and abrasive cleaners.\nPassive Locking and Unlocking\nLocking and unlocking Model Y with your key fob is \nconveniently hands-free. Although you must be carrying a \npaired key fob, there is no need to use it. Model Y has \nsensors around the vehicle that can recognize the presence \nof a key fob within a range of approximately six feet (two \nmeters). Therefore, you can keep your key fob in your pocket \nor purse and simply pull on the door handle to unlock. When \ncarrying your key fob with you, you can also open the trunk \nwithout having to use the key by pressing the liftgate's \nexterior door handle. If Walk-Away Door Lock is enabled, \nModel Y automatically locks when you exit and the key fob is \nno longer in range (see Walk-Away Door Lock on page 25). \nPassive locking and unlocking is automatically enabled when \nyou pair your key fob to Model Y.\nAlthough you can use the same key fob with multiple \nvehicles, it can only be paired to one vehicle at a time.

These thresholds are designed to \npredict the severity of a crash in time for the airbags to help \nprotect the vehicle's occupants. Airbags inflate instantly with \nconsiderable force accompanied by a loud noise. The inflated \nbag, together with the seat belts, limits movement of \noccupants to reduce the risk of injury.\nFront airbags are not ordinarily designed to inflate in rear \ncollisions, rollovers, side collisions and when braking heavily \nor driving over bumps and potholes. Likewise, front airbags \nmay not inflate in all frontal collisions, such as minor front \ncollisions, underride collisions, or minor impacts with narrow \nobjects (such as posts or poles). Significant superficial \ndamage can occur to the vehicle without the airbags inflating \nand, conversely, a relatively small amount of structural \ndamage can cause airbags to inflate. Therefore, the external \nappearance of the vehicle after a collision does not represent \nwhether or not the front airbags should have inflated.\nWARNING: Before modifying your vehicle to \naccommodate a person with disabilities in a way that \nmay affect the airbag system, use the mobile app to \nschedule a service appointment.\nTypes of Airbags\nModel Y has the following types of airbags:\n\u2022 Front airbags: The front airbags are designed to reduce \ninjuries if larger children or adults are riding in the front \nseats. Follow all warnings and instructions related to \nseating a child on the front passenger seat (if permitted in \nyour market region).\n\u2022 Knee airbags: Knee airbags and the front airbags work \ntogether. The knee airbags limit the forward motion of the \nfront seat occupants by restricting leg movement, thereby \npositioning the occupants so that the front airbags work \nmore effectively.\n\u2022 Seat-mounted side airbags: A seat-mounted side airbag \nin the front seats helps protect the pelvis and the thorax \nregion of the torso; the seat-mounted far side airbag in \nthe inside portion of the driver\u2019s seat helps protect the \nhead and torso. The seat-mounted side airbags on both \nthe impacted and non-impacted side of the vehicle will \ninflate in the event of severe side impact or severe offset \nfrontal impact.", "10066": "The seat-mounted side airbags on both \nthe impacted and non-impacted side of the vehicle will \ninflate in the event of severe side impact or severe offset \nfrontal impact.\n\u2022 Curtain airbags: Curtain airbags help protect the head. \nCurtain airbags on both the impacted and non-impacted \nside of the vehicle will inflate only if a severe side impact \noccurs, or if the vehicle rolls over.\nAirbag Status Indicator\nThe status of the passenger front airbag displays in the top \ncorner of the touchscreen:\nBefore driving with a child seated on the \nfront passenger seat (if legally permitted in \nyour market region), always double-check \nthe status of the passenger front airbag to \nconfirm that it is OFF.

This \nis especially helpful in heavy traffic situations or when \nvehicles are constantly merging into different lanes. When \nModel Y detects other vehicles driving significantly slower, \nthe touchscreen highlights the adjacent lanes with arrows \nand detected vehicles in gray, and Model Y reduces the \ndriving speed as appropriate. To temporarily override this \nfeature, press the accelerator pedal.\nWhen following a vehicle, Autopilot remains active at low \nspeeds, even when Model Y comes to a full stop. For \nexample, Autopilot remains active even if Model Y slows \ndown to a complete or near-complete stop in heavy, stop-\nand-go traffic on a highway. When traffic starts moving more \nrapidly, Autopilot again accelerates up to the set speed.\nSometimes when Model Y is at a full stop, Autopilot goes into \na HOLD state. If this happens, briefly press the accelerator \npedal to resume cruising.\nWhen the HOLD status is active, the \ntouchscreen displays the HOLD icon and a \nmessage that indicates that you need to \nresume cruise control.\nModel Y goes into HOLD state while Autopilot is active in the \nfollowing circumstances:\n\u2022 Model Y has been at a standstill for 5 minutes.\n\u2022 Model Y detects a pedestrian (the HOLD state may clear \nwhen the pedestrian is no longer detected).\n\u2022 Model Y suddenly loses visibility of the vehicle in front of \nyou.\n\u2022 An obstacle is detected in front of Model Y.\nCruising Near or On Exits\nWhen you are cruising near an exit on a controlled-access \nhighway and engage the turn signal toward the off-ramp, \nAutopilot assumes you are exiting and begins to slow down \nModel Y. If you do not drive onto the off-ramp, Autopilot \nresumes cruising at the set speed.\nIn a region with right hand traffic, this occurs only when you \nengage the right turn signal when driving in the right-most \nlane within 164 ft.

Likewise in regions \nwith left hand traffic, this occurs when engaging the left turn \nsignal when driving in the left-most lane within 164 ft.", "10179": "(50 meters) of an exit. Likewise in regions \nwith left hand traffic, this occurs when engaging the left turn \nsignal when driving in the left-most lane within 164 ft. (50 \nmeters) of an exit.\nNOTE: If Navigate on Autopilot is active, Model Y will perform \na route-based lane change to enter the exit lane and take the \noff-ramp as necessary to follow the navigation route.\nWhen enabled while on a highway interchange or off-ramp, \nTraffic-Aware Cruise Control may reduce your set speed in \n5 mph (5 km/h) increments \u2013 to as slow as 25 mph (40 km/h) \n\u2013 to better match the reported speeds of other Tesla vehicles \nthat have driven at that specific location. To override this and \ncontinue cruising at your set speed, tap the accelerator \npedal. The new set speed is maintained for the duration of \nthe interchange or off-ramp (unless you override it or cancel \nAutopilot). After the interchange or off-ramp, the set speed \nmay revert or change as necessary based on the new \nlocation. For example, if you merged onto a different \nhighway, the set cruising speed reverts to what it was before \ndriving on the interchange.\nWARNING: In some cases (such as having insufficient \ndata), Traffic-Aware Cruise Control may not \nautomatically reduce the set speed on the highway \ninterchange or off-ramp. Do not rely on Traffic-Aware \nCruise Control to determine an appropriate driving \nspeed. Tesla recommends driving at a speed that is \nsafe for road conditions and within posted speed \nlimits.\nWhen cruising onto an on-ramp to a controlled-access \nhighway, Autopilot automatically adjusts the set cruising \nspeed to the speed limit of the highway, plus any offset you \nhave specified. If Navigate on Autopilot is engaged, it \ndisengages as you leave the controlled-access highway (see \nCanceling Autopilot on page 106).

The most important way to preserve the high \nvoltage Battery is to LEAVE YOUR VEHICLE PLUGGED IN \nwhen you are not using it. This is particularly important if you \nare not planning to drive Model Y for several weeks.\nNOTE: When left idle and unplugged, your vehicle \nperiodically uses energy from the Battery for system tests \nand recharging the low voltage battery when necessary.\nThere is no advantage to waiting until the Battery\u2019s level is \nlow before charging. In fact, the Battery performs best when \ncharged regularly.\nNOTE: If you allow the Battery to discharge to 0%, other \ncomponents may become damaged or require replacement \n(for example, the low voltage battery). In these cases, you are \nresponsible for repair and/or transporting expenses. \nDischarge-related expenses are not covered by the warranty \nor under the Roadside Assistance policy.\nThe peak charging rate of the Battery may decrease slightly \nafter a large number of DC Fast Charging sessions, such as \nthose at Superchargers. To ensure maximum driving range \nand Battery safety, the Battery charge rate is decreased \nwhen the Battery is too cold, the Battery\u2019s charge is nearly \nfull, and when the Battery conditions change with usage and \nage. These changes in the condition of the Battery are driven \nby battery physics and may increase the total Supercharging \nduration by a few minutes over time. You can minimize the \namount of charge time by using Trip Planner (if available in \nyour market region) to warm the Battery while driving to a \nSupercharger. See Trip Planner on page 163 for more \ninformation.\nBattery Care\nNever allow the Battery to fully discharge.\nEven when Model Y is not being driven, its Battery \ndischarges very slowly to power the onboard electronics. The \nBattery can discharge at a rate of approximately 1% per day, \nthough the discharge rate may vary depending on \nenvironmental factors (such as cold weather), vehicle \nconfiguration, and your selected settings on the \ntouchscreen. Situations can arise in which you must leave \nModel Y unplugged for an extended period of time (for \nexample, at an airport when traveling). In these situations, \nkeep the 1% in mind to ensure that you leave the Battery with \na sufficient charge level.", "10306": "In these situations, \nkeep the 1% in mind to ensure that you leave the Battery with \na sufficient charge level. For example, over a two week period \n(14 days), the Battery may discharge by approximately 14%.\nDischarging the Battery to 0% may result in damage to \nvehicle components. To protect against a complete \ndischarge, Model Y enters a low-power consumption mode \nwhen the displayed charge level drops to approximately 0%. \nIn this mode, the Battery stops supporting the onboard \nelectronics and auxiliary low voltage battery. Once this low-\npower consumption mode is active, immediately plug in \nModel Y to prevent a jump start and low voltage battery \nreplacement.\nNOTE: If Model Y is unresponsive and does not unlock, open, \nor charge, the low voltage battery may be discharged. In this \nsituation, try jump starting the low voltage battery (see Jump \nStarting on page 231). If the vehicle is still unresponsive, use \nthe mobile app to schedule a service appointment.\nTemperature Limits\nFor better long-term performance, avoid exposing Model Y \nto ambient temperatures above 140\u00b0 F (60\u00b0 C) or below \n-22\u00b0 F (-30\u00b0 C) for more than 24 hours at a time.\nEnergy Saving Feature\nModel Y has an energy-saving feature that reduces the \namount of energy being consumed by the displays when \nModel Y is not in use.

Under-inflation also \nreduces the vehicle's range and tire tread life.\nWARNING: The Low Tire Pressure indicator light alerts \nyou only in situations when a tire is below the \nrecommended threshold (as indicated on the Tire and \nLoading Information label) under normal driving \nconditions. It does not alert you when a tire is under-\ninflated based on the load you are carrying.\nWARNING: Check tire pressures using an accurate \npressure gauge when tires are cold. It takes only about \none mile (1.6 km) of driving to warm up the tires \nsufficiently to affect tire pressures. Parking the vehicle \nin direct sunlight or in hot weather can also affect tire \npressures. If you must check warm tires, expect \nincreased pressures.

Tires with a tread depth less than 4/32\u201d (3 mm) \nare more likely to hydroplane in wet conditions and should \nnot be used. Tires with a tread depth less than 5/32\u201d (4 mm) \ndo not perform well in snow and slush and should not be used \nwhen driving in winter conditions.\nModel Y is originally fitted with tires that have wear \nindicators molded into the tread pattern. When the tread has \nbeen worn down to 4/32\u201d (3 mm), the indicators start to \nappear at the surface of the tread pattern, producing the \neffect of a continuous band of rubber across the width of the \ntire. For optimal performance and safety, Tesla recommends \nreplacing tires before the wear indicators are visible.\nTo improve vehicle handling characteristics and minimize \nhydroplaning in wet conditions, put tires with the most tread \non the rear of the car.\nTire Rotation, Balance, and Wheel Alignment\nTesla recommends rotating the tires every 6,250 miles \n(10,000 km) or if tread depth difference is 2/32\" (1.5 mm) or \ngreater, whichever comes first.\nTire rotation is an essential part of tire maintenance. It helps \nmaintain an even treadwear pattern which enhances the tire's \noverall wear quality, decreases road noise and maximizes tire \nlife.\nVehicles with staggered wheels and non-directional tires can \nbe rotated side-to-side (left-to-right) but not front-to-back \nas the front and rear tire size is different. Left-to-right \nrotation can increase tread life by changing the direction of \nrotation for each tire and balancing shoulder wear.\nUnbalanced wheels (sometimes noticeable as vibration \nthrough the steering wheel) affect vehicle handling and tire \nlife. Even with regular use, wheels can get out of balance. \nTherefore, they should be balanced as required.\nIf tire wear is uneven (on one side of the tire only) or becomes \nabnormally excessive, check the wheel alignment.", "10339": "Even with regular use, wheels can get out of balance. \nTherefore, they should be balanced as required.\nIf tire wear is uneven (on one side of the tire only) or becomes \nabnormally excessive, check the wheel alignment. If the tires \nneed to be serviced, such as rotated or replaced, reset the \ntire configuration (see Tire Configuration on page 191) to \nimprove your driving experience.\nPunctured Tires\nA puncture eventually causes the tire to lose pressure, which \nis why it is important to check tire pressures frequently. \nPermanently repair or replace punctured or damaged tires as \nsoon as possible.\nYour tubeless tires may not leak when penetrated, provided \nthe object remains in the tire. If, however, you feel a sudden \nvibration or ride disturbance while driving, or you suspect a \ntire is damaged, immediately reduce your speed. Drive \nslowly, while avoiding heavy braking or sharp steering and, \nwhen safe to do so, stop the vehicle. Arrange to have Model \nY transported to a Tesla Service Center, or to a nearby tire \nrepair center.\nNOTE: In some cases, you can temporarily repair small tire \npunctures (under 1/4\u201d (6 mm)) using an optional tire repair kit \navailable from Tesla. This allows you to slowly drive Model Y \nto Tesla or to a nearby tire repair facility.\nWARNING: Do not drive with a punctured tire that has \nnot been repaired, even if the puncture has not caused \nthe tire to deflate. A punctured tire can deflate \nsuddenly at any time.\nFlat Spots\nIf Model Y is stationary for a long period, tires can form flat \nspots. When Model Y is driven, these flat spots cause a \nvibration which gradually disappears as the tires warm up and \nregain their original shape.\nTo minimize flat spots during storage, inflate tires to the \nmaximum pressure indicated on the tire wall. Then, before \ndriving, release air to adjust tire pressure to the \nrecommended levels.\nImproving Tire Mileage\nTo improve the mileage you get from your tires, maintain tires \nat the recommended tire pressures, observe speed limits and \nadvisory speeds, and avoid:\n\u2022 Pulling away quickly, or hard acceleration.\n\u2022 Fast turns and heavy braking.\n\u2022 Potholes and objects in the road.", "10340": "\u2022 Fast turns and heavy braking.\n\u2022 Potholes and objects in the road.\n\u2022 Hitting curbs when parking.\n\u2022 Contaminating tires with fluids that can cause damage.\nReplacing Tires and Wheels\nTires degrade over time due to the effects of ultraviolet light, \nextreme temperatures, high loads, and environmental \nconditions. It is recommended that tires are replaced every \nsix years, or sooner if required, even if tread depth is above \nthe minimum.\nWhen a tire set becomes worn, replace all four tires at the \nsame time. Choose a Tesla-approved tire which is designed \nspecifically for your vehicle. Most Tesla-approved tires can \nbe identified with a \"T-mark\" specification on the tire's \nsidewall (for example, T0, T1, T2). Tesla-approved tires are \ndesigned to work with electric drivetrains and optimize \nperformance, safety, reliability, and durability. For more \ninformation about Tesla-approved replacement tires, refer to \nthe Service Manual.\nTire Care and Maintenance\n188\nMODEL Y Owner's Manual", "10341": "NOTE: The T-mark identifies a specific tire's progression \naccording to Tesla specifications. For example, a T1 Michelin \nPrimacy is newer than a T0 Michelin Primacy, but is not \nnecessarily newer than other models of T0 tires.\nIf tires need to be replaced early, for example due to a flat \ntire, we recommend replacing the tires in pairs unless the \nother tires are within 2/32 in (1.5 mm) of tread depth of the \nnew tire. When replacing tires, it is important to match the \nbrand and model of the older tires. Always place a pair of new \ntires on the rear if all four tires are the same size. Always \nbalance the wheel and tire after replacing a tire. Consult with \na professional tire retailer and installer for further guidance. If \nyou replace your tires or install different ones, reset the tire \nconfiguration (see Tire Configuration on page 191). This \nresets the learned tire settings and improves the driving \nexperience on your new tires. It may take up to 24 hours after \na tire replacement or repair before the tire lubricant is \ncompletely dry and tires achieve maximum adherence to the \nrims. Avoid hard accelerations during this period to avoid tire \nslip on the rim.\nNOTE: Regardless of the number of tires replaced, a \ncomplete set of matching tires is recommended for optimum \nperformance.\nIf tires other than those specified are used, ensure that the \nload and speed ratings marked on the tire (see \nUnderstanding Tire Markings on page 219) equal or exceed \nthose of the original specification.\nFor the specification of the original wheels and tires installed \non Model Y, see Wheels and Tires on page 218.\nIf you replace a wheel, the TPMS (Tire Pressure Monitoring \nSystem) sensors need to be reset to ensure they provide \naccurate warnings when tires are under-inflated (see \nAutomatic Reset of TPMS Sensors on page 191).\nNOTE: Installing winter tires with aggressive compound and \ntread design may result in temporarily-reduced regenerative \nbraking power.
